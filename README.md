# SHIFTer

SHIFTer is an HTML5 / CSS / JavaScript platform videogame.

# Approach Taken

First, the player and the moving logic was created.

Then the game layout was created via a matrix. A method was created to inspect the value of every element, then return the tile. Since this method is called 60 times every second, the collision checker was included in the same method.

Lastly, the Main Menu, tutorial, sounds, and timer were included.

# Instructions

The objective of each level is to reach the door to the next level. Some levels require a key to unlock the door.

You move with the 'left’ and ‘right’ arrow keys || You jump with the ‘space’ or ‘up’ arrow key.

Most levels have two layers. Lighter colored tiles are walkable, while darker colored tiles are only walkable in the second layer.

You must switch between layers to solve the puzzle. Use "A" and "D" to switch between layers.

# MUSIC

All sounds were created by me
